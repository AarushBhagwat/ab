      <p><h2>B. Answer the Following questions in 30 words </h2><br>

        Q. 1. <br>
        
        Ans :- The three questions that occured to the King were :- <br>
        
        i) What is the right time to begin any action? <br>
        
        ii) Who are the most important people?<br>
        
        iii) What is the most important work?<br><br>
        
        Q. 2. <br>
        
        Ans :- The King went to the hermit to know the Satisfactory answer to his three questions. He went there alone and dressed like a commoner because the hermit only receives the common people. <br> <br>
        
        Q. 3. <br>
        
        Ans :- The bearded man was that enemy of the king who sware to revenge because the King who had executed his brother and seized his property. He had got wounded by the King's men as they recognised him when he came out from his hiding place to find the King.
        
    <br> Q. 4. <br>
        
        Ans :- Digging of earth saved the King's life because if he had not dug the earth for hermit, but he had gone his way, the bearded man would have attacked and probably killed him. <br><br> <br>
        
        
        
        II HOTS 
        
        <br>
        Ans :- The answer the King got to his three questions was the most important time is the present time when we have power to do something, the most important person is he with whom are dealing with, and the most important of work is to do him good, because for that purpose God has sent us into this life.
        
        On the basis of the above answer, we can easily say that there is a great importance of present moment in our life. We know that every future is bound to be present. So, if we only command our present, our past will automatically be good and we have no worry about the Future. <br> <br> <br>
        
        
        
        III LIFE SKILLS <br>
        
        
        
        Ans :- Yes, this statement is completely true. It has been beautifully justified in the story 'Three Questions' when the King asked the three questions the hermit did not answer quickly because he very well knew the power of experience of learning. Therefore, he wanted to give him answer of throught examples so that it could have a great impact on his mind. There are so many examples through which this statement has been justified.

        <br>
        <br>
        IV Values <br>
        
        
        Ans :- The purpose implied here is to do good to others. We all know that the main concern of the whole mankind is 'Charity' in other words helping others.
        
        As for as fulfilling of this purpose is concerned, we have to adopt some means which are honesty, kindness, cooperation, thoughtfulness and avoiding greed.
